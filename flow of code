MAIN FILE is index.html

In react application - index.js is loaded in index.html by react-scripts (in package.json)
In vite application - main.jsx is loaded in index.html by normal script tag

In main.jsx (or index.js in npx create....) -
jsx used to render HTML elements through javascript (custom tags) 
e.g - App tag - this function in written in App.jsx which return html code (Rendered on webpages)


Components are the functions stored in jsx files and exported AND their name must begin with UPPERCASE
In react app you may also use js files BUT in vite it must be jsx

ONLY ONE ELEMENT CAN BE RETURNED IN jsx file
to return multiple elements, put them inside a single tag like <> </> - empty tag

<App /> - it is calling App function (both will work inside render()) (same as writing html code directly inside render)
we can also write App() IF function is written inside the same file (exported function must be used as tags only)

To use js variables in html write them inside {}
eg- {variable} = here, {variable} is called expression and it is an evaluated expression ,i.e, only final evaluated outcome of js is written here,i.e, you cannot write js here
